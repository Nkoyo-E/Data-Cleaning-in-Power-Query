To details how I cleaned a dirty data showing sales entry in Power Query. I followed these steps:
1.	Opened the data file in power query and reviewed the dataset to identify inconsistencies.
2.	Replaced missing values with appropriate ones based on the context of the data.
3.	Corrected any errors in the data such as spelling mistakes, incorrect formatting or invalid characters.
4.	Standardized the data format across all columns and made sure they were consistent.
5.	Renamed the columns appropriately to ensure clarity of the data.


**Below shows the clean sales data ready for analysis**
